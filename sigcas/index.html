            <p>
                The SIGCAS Works In Progress program provides an opportunity for researchers to present their work and engage in discussions with the SIGCAS community. From my experience as both a presenter, attendee, and now host, I am not only amazed by the critical work that the community is engaged in, but have also received valuable feedback in my own research as well as learned of new research areas.
