            <h1>Brian Krupp</h1>
            <p>
                I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science at <a target=_blank href="https://www.bw.edu">Baldwin Wallace
                University</a>. I received my Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) from Cleveland State University in 2015
                under the
                supervision of Dr. Nigamanth Sridhar and Dr. Wenbing Zhao. You can find my Curriculum Vitae <a

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                My research interests are on how mobile and internet of things (IoT) can benefit the community,
                including, how we can better understand what mobile applications do with our data. I lead the <a
                    href="https://mops.bw.edu/" target="_blank">MOPS research group</a> which focuses on this research.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the support of the National Science Foundation, we are currently investigating how to provide
                localized air quality data to communities using an IoT-enabled air quality sensor that students in
                middle and high school can create. As part of this, we are building curriculum for an in-school program
                and test piloting this program this year at Incarnate Word Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are interested in any of the research or projects I am working on, please contact me.
